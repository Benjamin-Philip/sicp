* The Question
Observe that our model of evaluation allows for combinations whose operators are
compound expressions. Use this observation to describe the behaviour of the
following procedure:

#+begin_src scheme
(define (a-plus-abs-b a b)
  ((if (> b 0) + -) a b))
#+end_src
* The Answer

Adding a positive number and subtracting a negative number has the same effect
as adding the absolute value of a number. We are able to change the procedure as
observed. Thus ~+~ is returned as the procedure if ~b~ is greater than 0, and ~-~
otherwise.
